// Dart is an optionally typed language bcoz it supports both static and dynamic type checking

void main() {

  // Statically typed example
  var myVariable = 50; // Can also use int instead of var but the point is here the type is known at compile time

  myVariable = "Hello"; // Bcoz of that this will give an error
  print(myVariable);

}
